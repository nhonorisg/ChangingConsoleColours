little python project for changing colour in the terminal

## Some advices

Issues: If you get an error which is like: "fg or bg is not recognised",
        you will have to install "sty". Check in your terminal if "pip"
        is installed by typing "pip", if not, do the two steps bellow,
        else you will have to do the second step only.
        
        *NOTE* those advices are for Linux user, if you are on Windows
        you have normally "pip" already installed, then do the second step only.

solution: 1) You will have install "pip" the python package manager first,
             check on this link: https://linuxconfig.org/install-pip-on-linux.

          2) Finally, install "sty" using the command:"pip install sty".
	          *PAY ATTETION* : Do not add the command "sudo"
	           when you are executing this last command.
